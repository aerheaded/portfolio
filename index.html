    <h2>@About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm a 14 year old programming student from the Netherlands. I've been interested in tech all my life and started
      my programming journey when I was 12. I love making websites and learning more programming languages in my free
      time. This doesn't stop at just programming languages either; I'm fluent in English, Dutch, Portuguese, and I'm
      learning French, German, and Korean.<br>At school I study many programming languages, inluding HTML, CSS,
      Javascript, and Python. At home I enbroaden my knowledge on these languages and teach myself Unity and
      C#.<br>Outside of of school and technology, I enjoy playing the piano and exposing myself to art and new ideas to
      stay open-minded and creative.</p>
