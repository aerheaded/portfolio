    <p>I'm a 14 year old programming student from the Netherlands.<br> I love technology, and I love
      making websites and learning more programming languages.</p>
    <p>Currently, I study HTML, CSS, and Python at school. I like learning more HTML and teaching myself Javascript and
      Unity in my free time.<br> Outside of school and technology I enjoy playing the piano and learning new languages.
    </p>
    <p>I'm fluent in Dutch, English, and Portuguese. I'm also learning French and German.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>I often do projects in my free time to challenge and improve myself with new things and refresh what I already
      know. Here are some projects I've decided to show! Click the titles to open the websites in another tab :)</p>

    <h2><span style="color: #b79a86">@</span>CodingCore<span style="color: #b79a86"><em>!</em></span></h2>
    <p>CodingCore is a website I made for myself. I use a lot of websites when coding and I'm too lazy to keep typing
      in all my searches, so I just made this website to be able to press buttons instead of having to type everything
      out.<br> Coding Core includes resources such as images, pixels, gifs, HTML help (stackoverflow, HTML validator,
      etc), my favourite playlists I use as background music while coding, a functional note system, and more.
      Development started July 8, 2022 and is still ongoing. I've separated version 0.8 and 2.0, as I wanted to rewrite
      codingcore, but keep the original version. Version 0.8 hasn't been updated since July 25, 2022. Version 2.0 was
      created November 21, 2022 and is still in development.<br><a

        </a>
        <p>The HTML Exercise website was made purely to learn some new things about html & css and remember the basics
          since
          it'd been a while since I did HTML and CSS.<br> I made this around June 24 2022. </p><br>

      <h2><span style="color: #b79a86">@</span>Project Safe Society<span style="color: #b79a86"><em>!</em></span></h2>
    </a>
    <p>Project Veilige Samenleving (translated to English: Project Safe Society) was a project at my school in late
      March - early April of 2022. We received the assignment of showing how we could make our society safer. Me and the
      two classmates I worked with chose raising awareness about drugs and alcohol being used more by minors.</p>
    <p>I made the homepage and the "Manieren om te stoppen" ("Ways to stop") pages, and I helped my classmates with
      their pages a little. This wasn't one of my greatest works but it was one of the earliest and shows how far I've
      come.</p>
