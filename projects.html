      <h2>@Projects!</h2>
      <p>I often do projects in my free time to challenge and improve myself with new things and refresh what I already
        know. The projects are sorted from newest to oldest. Here are some projects I've decided to show!<br>Click the
        titles to open the websites in another tab :)</p>

        <h2>@Project_Smart_Studio</h2>
      </a><br>
      <p>This website was made as part of a larger project at my school, where we were given around 20 hours to make a
        mini smart studio using a 3D printer, Blender, and a <a href="
          https://microbit.org">micro:bit</a>, along with a website to "advertise" the studio. I made the entire
        website
        myself, and I helped with some of the micro:bit coding, as well as helping with the modeling of the mini
        furniture in Blender. This project ended June 22nd of 2023.</p>

        <h2>@Make_a_Menu</h2>
      </a><br>
      <p>This was another assignment for school, for which I was assigned to make a website around the theme "menu". I
        made this September 19th, 2022.</p>

        <h2>@Portfolio_version_1
        </h2>
      </a><br>
      <p>This website was created mostly to practice making a portfolio to prepare for the making of this portfolio.
        Simply put, it was an early version that didn't make it out of my files until now.<br>This website was created
        between early June and late July of 2022.</p>

      <img class="projects" src="codingcore1.png" alt="picture of the project"><br>
      <h2>@CodingCore</h2><br>
      <p>CodingCore is a website I made for myself. I use a lot of websites when coding and I'm too lazy to keep typing
        in all my searches, so I just made this website to be able to press buttons instead of having to type everything
        out.<br>Coding Core includes resources such as images, pixels, gifs, HTML help (stackoverflow, HTML validator,
        etc), my favourite playlists I use as background music while coding, a functional note system, and more.
        Development started July 8, 2022 and is still ongoing. I've separated version 0.8 and 2.0, as I wanted to
        rewrite codingcore, but keep the original version. Version 0.8 hasn't been updated since July 25, 2022. Version
        2.0 was created November 21, 2022 and is still in development.<br><a target="_blank"

        <h2>@HTML_Exercise
        </h2>
      </a><br>
      <p>The HTML Exercise website was made purely to learn some new things about html & css and remember the basics
        since it'd been a while since I did HTML and CSS. I made this around June 24 2022.</p>

        <h2>@Project_Safe_Society
        </h2>
      </a>
      <br>
      <p>Project Veilige Samenleving (translated to English: Project Safe Society) was a project at my school in late
        March - early April of 2022. We received the assignment of showing how we could make our society safer. Me and
        the two classmates I worked with chose raising awareness about drugs and alcohol being used more by minors.<br>I
        made the homepage and the "Manieren om te stoppen" ("Ways to stop") pages, and I helped my classmates with their
        pages a little. This wasn't one of my greatest works but it was one of the earliest and shows how far I've come.

        <h2>@My_first_website</h2>
      </a><br>
      <p>This was the very first website I've ever made. It was an assignment for school, for which I had to choose a
        person that was important to technology and make a website about them. I made this November 19th, 2022.</p>

    <h2>@About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm a 14 year old programming student from the Netherlands. I've been interested in tech all my life and started
      my programming journey when I was 12. I love making websites and learning more programming languages in my free
      time. This doesn't stop at just programming languages either; I'm fluent in English, Dutch, Portuguese, and I'm
      learning French, German, and Korean.<br>At school I study many programming languages, inluding HTML, CSS,
      Javascript, and Python. At home I enbroaden my knowledge on these languages and teach myself Unity and
      C#.<br>Outside of of school and technology, I enjoy playing the piano and exposing myself to art and new ideas to
      stay open-minded and creative.</p>
